Active Bayesian Deep Learning
==============================

Methods related to Active Bayesian Deep Learning, including use cases on various data sets.

Setup
------------

Start by creating a virtual environment - experiments were run and tested with Python 3.11.
```
conda create -n abdl python=3.11
conda activate abdl
```

Install the requirements and the repository as a module by running the following from the root:
```
pip install -e .
```

### Installing `torch`

The project was run using CUDA 11.7. The associated `torch`-version can be installed by running:
```
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
```
